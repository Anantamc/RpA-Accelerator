# Partner Dashboard Sharing Options

This document outlines various methods for sharing your Partner Revenue & Activity Dashboard with others who may not have the required packages installed.

## Option 1: Standalone Executable (Windows Only)

Create an executable file that can run without any Python installation:

1. Run `build_executable.bat`
2. Share the generated `.exe` file from the `dist` folder

**Pros:**
- No Python or dependencies required
- Single file execution
- Works for non-technical users

**Cons:**
- Windows-only
- Large file size
- May be flagged by security software

## Option 2: Docker Container (Cross-Platform)

Package the application as a Docker container:

1. Run `build_docker.bat` (requires Docker installed)
2. Export and share the Docker image

**Pros:**
- Works on any OS with Docker
- Consistent environment
- Includes all dependencies

**Cons:**
- Requires Docker knowledge
- Recipients need Docker installed

## Option 3: Streamlit Cloud (Web-Based)

Deploy the app to Streamlit's cloud service:

1. Follow instructions in `STREAMLIT_CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Share the generated URL with recipients

**Pros:**
- No installation required for recipients
- Access from any device with a browser
- Always up to date

**Cons:**
- Requires GitHub account
- Public by default (unless on paid plan)
- Requires internet access to use

## Option 4: Portable Package (Windows)

Create a portable package with Python included:

1. Run `create_portable_package.bat`
2. Share the `portable_dashboard` folder (zip it first)

**Pros:**
- Works without Python installation
- Does not require admin rights
- More flexible than executable

**Cons:**
- Larger package size
- Windows-focused (may work on other OS with modifications)

## Recommendation

For the simplest sharing experience:

1. **Non-technical users:** Use Option 3 (Streamlit Cloud) if you're comfortable with GitHub
2. **Technical users with reliable internet:** Use Option 2 (Docker)
3. **Technical users without reliable internet:** Use Option 4 (Portable Package)
4. **Windows-only users who prefer simplicity:** Use Option 1 (Executable)
